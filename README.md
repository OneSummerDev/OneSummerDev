I’m a Unity, Unreal and Arduino developer
interested in creating immersive XR!
My background is in VFX, and now I’m working to
extend that “movie magic” into reality.

Custom event experiences, Immersive art installation,
pathfinding, bespoke human interface devices, the works!

I currently don’t have any code posted, sorry about that.
But wanted to officially join the GitHub community and
start sharing back!
